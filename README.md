Snake-Table-Cells
=================

play the game : http://davedave.us/snake/

classic nokia style snake game using table cells

I did this years ago to learn javascript, hopefully it's helpful to others.

Use the canvas?
----------------
no, the whole point is to render in the table cells.  It's for educational purposes.
You learn a lot by programming this way, and you unlearn a lot if you're accustomed to OOP, I was,
so learning goes both ways.

Table Cells, wtf?
------------------
I found that the browser ( at the time, may have changed ) crashed quite often at instances of over 1000 divs.  
However, using table cells, I could run this game with great performance using over 9000 table cell instances.

I hope to build an engine in table cells, and I think it would be hilarious to put this game into a UIWebview
and distribute in the mac app store.

I've actually already added touch events as a test and tested on iPad a couple years ago, it would work fine.

All we need is a physics engine for table cells.... and we've got a company!!! who's with me
